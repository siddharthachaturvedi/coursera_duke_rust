# Duke Rust Specialization Journey

Hello, I'm Siddhartha Chaturvedi, a Director of Product Management at Microsoft and an enthusiast for constant learning. As a part of my re-learning journey, I wanted to push myself to pick languages and use cases that I have not previously explored to code by myself. Rust, one of the most loved languages, has been on my bucket list.

[Rust Programming Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/rust-programming) will reintroduce me to systems programming. Here, I will be documenting my progress, insights, and projects that I develop as I advance through the courses. The journey covers extensive ground in Rust, from data engineering to DevOps and LLM operations.

## Acknowledgments

A special thank you to my mentors and peers at Microsoft who have supported and inspired me to pursue this, and for the BITS Pilani Education Plus Program for allowing me access to this specialization. 

## Specialization Overview

Rust is a language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software. This specialization has been a thorough adventure through Rust's capabilities, touching on data engineering, Linux tools, DevOps, and Large Language Model (LLM) operations. Each course will bolster my expertise that I have had over the years.

### Course 1: Rust Fundamentals
- Apply Rust's core concepts like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes to write efficient, reliable, and safe code.
- Utilize Rust's advanced features like enums, structs, traits, and generics to construct robust applications.
- Develop, document, test, and debug Rust projects with Cargo, Rust Analyzer, and other tools in the Rust ecosystem.

### Course 2: Data Engineering with Rust
- Enhance data engineering skills with Rust's efficiency, safety, and concurrency.
- Dive into Rust's data structures and collections, and learn about its safety and security features in data engineering.
- Explore data engineering libraries and tools like Diesel, async, Polars, and Apache Arrow.
- Interface with data processing systems, REST, gRPC protocols, and AWS SDK for cloud-based operations.
- Design and implement comprehensive data processing systems using Rust.

### Course 3: Rust for DevOps
- Apply DevOps principles and workflows with Rust, containers, logging, and monitoring.
- Gain system observability by instrumenting applications using frameworks like ELK stack and Prometheus.
- Improve efficiency by automating system administration tasks using Rust.

### Course 4: Python and Rust with Linux Command Line Tools
- Build powerful command line tools using Rust and Python.
- Leverage Python and Rust's interoperability to construct versatile tools.

### Course 5: Rust for Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps)
- Deploy Rust for complex LLMOps workflows, focusing on performance and efficiency.
